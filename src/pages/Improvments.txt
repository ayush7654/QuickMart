Error Handling:

Your API calls could benefit from enhanced error handling, like displaying a user-friendly error message if the API call fails.
Consider adding error boundaries to catch and handle errors in your React components.


Code Reusability:

The handleChanged function in Registration can be simplified and generalized to handle all input changes without checking the name attribute each time.
Breadcrumb Implementation:

The Breadcrumb functionality appears underdeveloped. You might consider improving it by adding a more complex breadcrumb trail that reflects the user's navigation path.


Authentication Logic:

The login mechanism is somewhat basic and should include form validation (e.g., ensuring email format) and error messages if login fails.
Consider redirecting to the home page or another appropriate page after successful login.


Accessibility:

Ensure your app is accessible by adding ARIA labels, alt texts for images, and using semantic HTML where possible.


Performance Optimization:

Use React.memo to prevent unnecessary re-renders of components like Header or ProductCard when the props or context values haven't changed.
Implement lazy loading of components or images to improve the app's performance.


Styling Consistency:

Ensure consistent styling across the app. For example, the navlink-selected and navlink classes have different styles, but both are used for navigation. Consider harmonizing these styles.


Refactoring of Repeated Logic:

The product fetching logic in Store could be moved into a custom hook to avoid repetition and improve maintainability.


Component Organization:

Consider separating large components into smaller, reusable components for better readability and maintenance. For example, the Header component could be broken down into smaller parts like Logo, NavBar, and Breadcrumbs.
